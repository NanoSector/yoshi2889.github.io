      <description>Someone who has checked out this site before might have noticed it, for the longest time, had a dreadful &amp;ldquo;403 Forbidden&amp;rdquo; error. Oops.
The reason for this is pretty simple: I never bothered to set up a site and configure Nginx with it. It tried to access static content, failed because there was no index.html, tried a directory listing, also failed there because it is not configured to allow this and well, there we are.</description>
