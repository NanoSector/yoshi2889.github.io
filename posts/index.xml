      <description>Recently I purchased a supposedly faulty A1342 MacBook6,1 (&amp;lsquo;09 13&amp;quot; white MacBook). The listing mentioned it &amp;ldquo;would no longer turn on&amp;rdquo; and the seller tried various things to get it back to life, to no avail. Let&amp;rsquo;s diagnose and fix it!
Diagnosis: First boot Unboxing the laptop from its original box (what a find!), it indeed did not turn on. The SIL (Sleep Indicator Light) would flash a few times, which according to Apple&amp;rsquo;s website meant the battery was faulty.</description>

      <description>Someone who has checked out this site before might have noticed it, for the longest time, had a dreadful &amp;ldquo;403 Forbidden&amp;rdquo; error. Oops.
The reason for this is pretty simple: I never bothered to set up a site and configure Nginx with it. It tried to access static content, failed because there was no index.html, tried a directory listing, also failed there because it is not configured to allow this and well, there we are.</description>
